# vuepoint-new

This is a "fork" of [vuepoint](https://github.com/mattbrailsford/vuepoint).

I created a new project with vue cli 3, copied the source from vuepoint, adjusted a few path and got it to compile.

I'm trying to live update charts with vue-chartjs reactive data and prop.


This is a temporary repo for fixing a few issues. Fork at your own risk.
